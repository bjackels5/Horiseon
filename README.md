# Hori*seo*n
This is the first challenge for the Coding Bootcamp I'm in. I've modified the code - html and css - for an SEO company named Hori*seo*n.

This is quite a short readme file, but I'm going to add a table of contents anyway just for practice.

## Functionality Changes
Some of the changes were required to make the website work properly:
* one of the menu items didn't actually link to anything
* none of the images were screen reader friendly
* HTML semantics were pretty much missing entirely from the index.html file, and that also affects screen readers.

## Code Cleanup
The style file had lots of code duplication. Leaving it like that would make future changes quite frustrating, or at least more work than necessary.

## Short Times Betweeen Commits
I originally forgot to copy all the files to a brand new project. After making a bunch of changes, I realized I needed to create a new project, and then I copied over all the changes I'd made. This is why the first 2-3 commits are very close in time.
